To developers or users:

Unfortunately I was not able to create an instructions tab in the game
so I hope you'll find this useful. 

There are 8 players in the game competing in a tournament to see who can
type a sequence of letters the fastest. It will start by displaying the bracket
and you'll notice that the bracket consists of rectangles, names inside the rectangles and lines.
The names inside the rectangles who in that particular round are competing against each other. You 
can start with any rectangle that contains the names to start the game. Keep in mind that the player
name displayed on the top of "vs." represents Player 1 and the name below that represents Player 2.
This information will be relevant when you see two letters side by side in the middle. Player 1 will
be tasked to type the letter on the left side, which is colored in blue and Player 2 will be tasked to
type the letter on the right colored in red. As each player types the letters displayed on the screen a
new letter will pop up until someone wins which is shown by "Name has won" here you can press the back button
which will take you back to the bracket which should update the round above with whoever won.
